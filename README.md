# Bootify

* copy the Bootify theme into App Theme directory
* Set App to Use theme
* Setup AssetCompress (with Lessphp in views on the 0.3.0 branch)
* Config AssetCompress to process the less files from where you have got them (copy them from Bootify Plugin)

## todo 

almost everything!

* make shell to copy theme less into app
* customise the less lib files (tweak for cake)
* review existing bootstrap css projects for inclusion of ideas
